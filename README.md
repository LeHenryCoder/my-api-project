# Title 
Simple Python Banking API
Description
This project is focused on building a Simple Python Banking API using AWS Cloud9. The API is designed to simulate basic banking operations, providing a learning platform for understanding API development and cloud integration. The API is implemented in Python and serves as an example of how to structure and develop a RESTful API for banking-related functions.

Key Features:

Account Information Retrieval: Allows users to fetch basic account details like account number, balance, and account type.
Transaction History: Enables users to view a list of their recent banking transactions.
Simple and Scalable Design: The project aims to maintain simplicity while allowing for future scalability to include more features.
Technologies Used:

Python: For creating the API endpoints and business logic.
AWS Cloud9: Utilized as the cloud-based integrated development environment for writing, running, and debugging the code.
Git and GitHub: For version control and source code management.
Learning Objectives:

Understanding RESTful API development in Python.
Gaining practical experience with AWS services, particularly Cloud9.
Exploring version control practices using Git and GitHub.
Project Status: This project is currently in the development phase and is open to contributions, suggestions, and feedback.
